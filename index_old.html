		<p>"Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"

One, two, three, four
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe

She'd been drinkin' too much egg nog
And we'd begged her not to go
(Don't go, grandma)
But she'd forgot her medication
So she stumbled out the door into the snow

When they found her Christmas mornin'
At the scene of the attack
(Let me tell you something)
She had hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back

Two, three

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe

Now were all so proud of Grandpa
He's been takin' this so well
See him in there watchin' football
(Hallelujah)
Playin' cards and drinkin' beer with cousin Mel

And it's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
(Amazing grace)
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?
(send them back?)

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And a blue and silver candles
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig

I've warned all my friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves
(Sing it right)
They should never give a license, no
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves

And that's why grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe!
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe!
			Yes, as for me and Grandpa, we believe!</p>
